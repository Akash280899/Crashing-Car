# Crashing-Car

This is Car collision detection project. It's done using `JQuery`. 


Basic explanation of project : Three parallel lane road with blue cars coming top to bottom of the screen. Clicking on any lane should bring a new red car from bottom to top. If there any interaction or collision between two cars must alert "crashed" with model open.
